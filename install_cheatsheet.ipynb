    "  * Use `sudo` for one package manager (usually the package manager for your OS).\n",

    "  * This also applies when you are building/compiling things.\n",

    "  * It is much easier to find and fix problems if you stay local. Worse case, we make a new user.\n",
    "  * It is **very much harder** to find and fix problems if your system is screwed up. Worse case, we\n",

    "* Try not to use environment variables, such as `PYTHONPATH`, especially in your bashrc.\n",
    "  * This causes some problems if you use more than one version of python.\n",
    "  * Use the `setup.py`.\n",
    "  * Use virtual environments.\n",
